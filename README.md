Objective: Recognize movies from random screenshots or images.
Key Focus Areas:
Scene Recognition: Identify specific movie scenes using screenshots.
Metadata Mapping: Match recognized scenes to metadata (e.g., movie title, description).
Expandability: Allow users to upload images and detect movies efficiently.
Actionable Step: Decide whether you want to focus on a specific genre, language, or time period for movies first. This can simplify dataset preparation and model training.
